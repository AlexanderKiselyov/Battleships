&nbsp &nbsp "Sea Battle" is a game for two participants, in which the players play
queues name coordinates on the opponent's map unknown to them. <br>
If the opponent has a ship at these coordinates, ie <br>
coordinates are occupied, then the ship or its part is "sunk", and <br>
the one who got gets the right to make one more move. Goal first <br>
sink all enemy ships. <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Rules for placing ships (fleet): <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The playing field is usually a 10 Ã— 10 square for each player on which <br>
hosts a fleet of ships. Verticals are numbered from top to bottom, and <br>
contours are marked with letters from left to right. Moreover, <br>
the letters of the Latin alphabet are used from "a" to "j". <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1 ship - a row of 4 cells ("four-deck") <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2 ships - a row of 3 cells ("three-deck") <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3 ships - a row of 2 cells ("double-deck") <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4 ships - 1 cell ("single-deck") <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp When placed, ships cannot touch each other by sides and corners. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp When hitting the enemy ship, it is placed on a foreign field <br>
cross, with a blank shot - a point. The victim shoots again. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The most vulnerable are the battleship and the torpedo boat: the first because<br>
of large size, in connection with which it is relatively easy to find, and the second <br>
due to the fact that it is drowned with one blow, although it is quite difficult to find it. <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Sinking enemy ships: <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Before the start of hostilities, players throw lots or <br>
agree on who will go first. The player taking the move <br>
fires a shot - aloud the coordinates of the cell in which, <br>
in his opinion, there is an enemy ship, for example, "B1". <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 1. If the shot hits a cell that is not occupied by any <br>
by the enemy ship, then the answer is "Past!" and the shooting player <br>
puts a dot on someone else's square in this place. The right to move passes <br>
to the opponent. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 2. If the shot hits the cage where <br>
a multi-decked ship (larger than 1 cell) then follows <br>
the answer is "Ranil (a)!" or "Hit (s)!", except in one case (see point 3). <br>
The shooting player puts a cross in this cell on a foreign field, and his <br>
the opponent puts a cross in his field also in this cell. <br>
The shooting player gets the right to one more shot. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 3. If the shot hits the cage where <br>
one-pipe ship, or the last unaffected cell <br>
multi-deck ship, the answer follows "Killed (a)!" or <br>
"I sunk (a)!" Both players mark the sunken ship <br>
on the sheet. The shooting player gets the right to one more shot. <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The winner is the one who sinks all 10 ships first <br>
enemy. The loser has the right to ask to study after <br>
the end of the game at the opponent's playing field. If the loser finds <br>
any violation of the rules (see below), then the victory is awarded to him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp The original winner may ask for <br>
the opponent has a playing field to search for violations. If he finds them, <br>
then the players compare other people's fields with each other. If no c
no discrepancies are noticed, the game does not count <br>
(both lost). The one who has the wrong field <br>
(provably false), will be the loser, and his opponent <br>
the winner. <br>
The game may also end before all are sunk <br>
ships if a violation of the rules is noticed during the game. <br>
The loser in this case will be the one who is found to have <br>
breaking the rules, although he can also ask for the playing field <br>
from the opponent to search for violations. <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Ofacts: <br> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 1. The player has his own field drawn incorrectly: <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The number of ships does not match the rules; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ships touch each other; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wrong field sizes; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Invalid coordinate system. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 2. The player made changes on his playing field, <br>
not provided for by the rules of the game (during the game you can bet <br>
only dots and crosses and only according to the rules), for example, I finished drawing <br>
missing ship [1]; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 3. The player spied on the location of the enemy ships [1]; <br>
&nbsp &nbsp 4. The player missed his turn. <br> <br>
